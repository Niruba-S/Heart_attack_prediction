Heart Attack Prediction using Gaussian Naive Bayes.
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) algorithm. Heart attack prediction is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This project utilizes a dataset containing various health parameters to train a GNB model, which can then predict the probability of a heart attack occurrence.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle and contains a variety of features related to heart health, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant parameters. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the quality of input data for training the GNB model.
